/*
An INSTEAD OF trigger is a trigger that allows you to skip an INSERT, DELETE,
or UPDATE statement to a table or a view and execute other statements defined
in the trigger instead. The actual insert, delete, or update operation does not occur at all.

In other words, an INSTEAD OF trigger skips a DML statement and execute other statements.


	CREATE TRIGGER [schema_name.] trigger_name
	ON {table_name | view_name }
	INSTEAD OF {[INSERT] [,] [UPDATE] [,] [DELETE] }
	AS
	{sql_statements}

*/

/*

A typical example of using an INSTEAD OF trigger is to override an insert,
update, or delete operation on a view.

Suppose, an application needs to insert new brands into the production.brands table.
However, the new brands should be stored in another table called production.brand_approvals
for approval before inserting into the production.brands table.

To accomplish this, you create a view called production.vw_brands for the application to insert new brands.
If brands are inserted into the view, an INSTEAD OF trigger will be fired
to insert brands into the production.brand_approvals table.
*/

/*
The following statement creates a new table named production.brand_approvals
for storing pending approval brands:
*/

CREATE TABLE production.brand_approvals(
    brand_id INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    brand_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

/*
The following statement creates a new view named production.vw_brands against the production.brands
and production.brand_approvals tables:
*/
CREATE VIEW production.vw_brands 
AS
SELECT
    brand_name,
    'Approved' approval_status
FROM
    production.brands
UNION
SELECT
    brand_name,
    'Pending Approval' approval_status
FROM
    production.brand_approvals;

/*
Once a row is inserted into the production.vw_brands view, we need to route it to the
production.brand_approvals table via the following INSTEAD OF trigger:
*/

CREATE TRIGGER production.trg_vw_brands 
ON production.vw_brands
INSTEAD OF INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    INSERT INTO production.brand_approvals ( 
        brand_name
    )
    SELECT
        i.brand_name
    FROM
        inserted i
    WHERE
        i.brand_name NOT IN (
            SELECT 
                brand_name
            FROM
                production.brands
        );
END

/*
The trigger inserts the new brand name into the production.brand_approvals
if the brand name does not exist in the production.brands.

Letâ€™s insert a new brand into the production.vw_brands view:
*/

INSERT INTO production.vw_brands(brand_name)
	VALUES('Eddy Merckx');

/*
This INSERT statement fired the INSTEAD OF trigger to insert a new row into
the production.brand_approvals table.

If you query data from the production.vw_brands table, you will see a new row appear:
*/

SELECT
	brand_name,
	approval_status
FROM
	production.vw_brands;

/*
The following statement shows the contents of the production.brand_approvals table:
*/

SELECT 
	*
FROM 
	production.brand_approvals;
